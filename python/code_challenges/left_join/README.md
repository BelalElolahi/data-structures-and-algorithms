# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
The `LEFT JOIN `keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2).

## Challenge
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

Write a function called left join
Arguments: two hash maps
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
